========

small project used to introduce my dev team to TDD. I chose the bowling kata for being simple to implement and having obvious test cases

list remote branch with "git branch -a" command
switch to a specific branch with the command "git checkout <name_of_branch>" each branch is the full implementation of a step from this tutorial


run "npm install" command to download dependecies, then "npm test" to execute unit test
